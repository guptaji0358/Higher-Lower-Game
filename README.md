# 🎮 Higher or Lower Game – Python Project 🚀

An interactive **Higher or Lower game** built in Python where players guess who has more followers between two randomly chosen personalities. The game runs in the console with a fun ASCII art interface, emojis, and replay logic.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Champion Logic** 🏆  
  After each round, the winner (whether A or B) becomes the new champion for the next comparison.

- **Replay System** 🔄  
  When you lose, you’re asked if you want to play again. Type **YES** to restart instantly, or **NO** to exit with a thank‑you note. Invalid inputs trigger a retry until you type a valid choice.

- **Engaging Console Experience** 🎨  
  Cool wording and emojis make the text‑based interface lively and fun. Instead of plain prompts, you’ll see messages like:  
  - `🔥 Compare A`  
  - `⚡ Compare B`  
  - `✅ Correct! 🎉 +1 point`

- **Clean Modular Code** 🧩  
  Functions like `Check_answer`, `formatted_data`, and `play_game` keep the logic neat, reusable, and easy to expand.
